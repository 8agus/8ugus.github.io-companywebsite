# Challenge Project: Company Home Page with Flexbox

## Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the Internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve. 

Project Goals

In this project, you’ll be using flexbox to design and build the layout for a company’s homepage. You can choose to build a new homepage for an existing company or imagine your own dream company! 

You’re going to build a company homepage for a real or imagined company. You’ll get to decide exactly what content to include for this company, but you should at least include:

* A title and logo or splash image.
* A mission statement or brief description of the company.
* A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
* A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.

If you want, you can tour our example site for inspiration or to see how we used flexbox. Your site will probably look very different from ours, and that’s great!
